        "Watching Stella evolve as a person, as a woman and as an artist,
        through her artwork, has been an absolute delight. For me, it was not a
        matter of whether I would own one of Stella's paintings, there was never
        any doubt about that. The only question I had, was which one I would
        connect with, so I waited while, feeling my way to the one for me. As
        soon as I saw the old turtle painting, I knew! It jumped out of the
        computer screen and it seemed that it actually did speak to me, and I
        immediately connected!"

        "Stella's art has a kind of extra magic, a way of speaking out as though
        tellling a story, and I love that one can feel the painting as though
        it's breathing, filed with life. Love the art, love the artist."

        depth into the beautiful creatures and scenic wonders of nature!!
        Absolutely thrilled to own her artwork and show it off! Every single
        piece is just one of a kind, and we are lucky to own a few! Thank you"
