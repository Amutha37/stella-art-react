The only question I had, was which one I\n          would connect with, so I waited while, feeling my way to the one for\n          me. As soon as I saw the old turtle painting, I knew! It jumped out of\n          the computer screen and it seemed that it actually did speak to me,\n          and I immediately connected!\"\n        </p>\n        <br></br>\n\n        <p>\n          \"Stella's art has a kind of extra magic, a way of speaking out as\n          though tellling a story, and I love that one can feel the painting as\n          though it's breathing, filed with life.
