Putting her\n          heart and soul into every painting, she desires that the viewer/\n          collector feels connected to her paintings and wants them to feel as\n          though they are stepping into another world. */}\n        </p>\n        <br></br>\n        <p>\n          As a young child, Stella had a longing to create anything, she enjoyed\n          making something out of nothing which gave her a sense of\n          satisfaction. She would sit at her mothers sewing machine for hours at\n          a time, and try to design a dress for her dolls with the left over\n          material her mum was ready to scrap. Her favourite subject in school\n          was Arts, and Stella loved listening to the teachers stories from the\n          previous artist history. Her teacher asked the students to paint\n          something which they felt connected to. Stella went on to paint a\n          large canvas of Crying Girl, by Roy Lichtenstein, which was her 1st\n          ever painting.\n          <br></br> <br></br>\n          During her career life she worked in various office roles, which\n          didn't leave room for her creativity. She then decided to work in an\n          Art-shop to help her further explore that field. Then she decided to\n          enrol in art-classes with artist Christopher Vidal to learn to draw\n          and paint in oils, and then she would practice for many hours a day to\n          better her skill in drawing and painting.\n          <br></br> <br></br>\n        </p>\n        {/* ARTIST STATEMENT */}\n        <h3>Artist's statement</h3>\n        <p>\n          <br></br> <br></br>I love painting a variety of subjects such as\n          florals, wildlife, landscapes, seascapes and portraits.
