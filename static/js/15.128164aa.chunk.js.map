She loves painting a variety of subjects including florals,\n          wildlife, landscapes, seascapes and portraits. She paints mainly in\n          artists grade oil paints such as Windsor and Newton paints, Michael\n          Harding and Art Spectrum on canvas or wooden board ensuring her\n          surface is well prepared and varnished for longevity. Putting her\n          heart and soul into every painting, she desires that the viewer/\n          collector feels connected to her paintings and wants them to feel as\n          though they are stepping into another world.\n        </p>\n        <br></br> <br></br>\n        <h3>My Story</h3>\n        <p>\n          <br></br> <br></br>\n          As a young child, Stella had a longing to create anything, she enjoyed\n          making something out of nothing and gave her a sense of satisfaction.\n          She would sit at her mothers sewing machine for hours at a time, and\n          try to design a dress for her dolls with the left over material her\n          mum was ready to scrap. Her favourite subject in school was Arts, and\n          Stella loved listening to the teachers stories from the previous\n          artist history. Her teacher asked the students to paint something\n          which they felt connected to. Stella went on to paint a large canvas\n          of Crying Girl, by Roy Lichtenstein, which was her 1st ever painting.\n          She hoped one day she will become an artist but noone around her\n          thought there couldn't possible be a career in that, so she put it in\n          the back of her mind.\n          <br></br> <br></br>\n          During her career life she worked in various office roles, which\n          didn't leave room for her creativity. She then decided to work in an\n          art-shop to help her further explore that field. Then she decided to\n          enrol in art-classes with Artist Christopher Vidal to learn to draw\n          and paint in oils. She hasn't stopped since, and is grateful for the\n          step she chose to take that was her desire.\n          <br></br> <br></br>\n          Stella also loves to go plein-air painting outdoors whenever possible,\n          staying connected to other artists and she constantly seeks\n          improvement in all her work to ensure the last painting is better then\n          the previous.\n          <br></br> <br></br>\n          \"Art speaks where words are unable to explain.\" by Mathiole\"\n          <br></br> <br></br>\n        </p>\n        <div id='exhibitionNote'>\n          <h3>Exhibitions</h3>\n          <p>Solo Exhibition,</p>\n          <p>Art House Cafe,</p>\n          <p>Narellan.</p>\n          <p>January 2021.</p>\n          <br></br>\n\n          <p>Blue Mountains Art Prize</p>\n          <p>Budgies in love</p>\n          <p>August 2019.</p>\n          <br></br>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n","export function SocialMedia() {\n  return (\n    <div className='social-media'>\n      {/* <div className=\"social-media\"> */}\n      {/* <div className='followMe-text'> */}\n      <div id='followMe-text'>\n        <p>Follow me ⤵️ </p>\n      </div>\n      <div className='icons'>\n        <a href='https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=stellas_art'>\n          <div className='layer'>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span className='fab fa-facebook-f'></span>\n          </div>\n          <div className='text'>Facebook</div>\n        </a>\n        <a href='https://twitter.com/KypriotisStella'>\n          <div className='layer'>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span className='fab fa-twitter'></span>\n          </div>\n          <div className='text'>Twitter</div>\n        </a>\n        <a href='https://www.instagram.com/stellas_art3/'>\n          <div className='layer'>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span className='fab fa-instagram'></span>\n          </div>\n          <div className='text'>Instagram</div>\n        </a>\n        <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/stella-kypriotis-949101206/'>\n          <div className='layer'>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span></span>\n            <span className='fab fa-linkedin-in'></span>\n          </div>\n          <div className='text'>Linkedin</div>\n        </a>\n        {/* </div> */}\n      </div>\n\n      <div className='footertext'>\n        <p>\n          Copyright <i className='far fa-copyright'> </i> Stella Kypriotis 2021\n          All Right Reserved.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { SocialMedia } from '../fetchMessage/SocialMedia';\nimport './footer.css';\n\nfunction Footer() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <SocialMedia />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Footer;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
